# Date Header

This component is used to actually create an indicator for a date. 
Typically it's a child component of the `<DateCell />` component. 

It wraps around the date string and provides a selected state. This is mainly
to indicate a date as today. 

To style this component add a style object to your theme of the form

```js dark
{
  calendar: {
    dateHeader: {
      basic: { 
        // Styles go here..
      },
      selected: { 
        // Styles go here..
      },
    }
  }
}
```
