# Simple Calendar

Simple calendar is meant to primarily show events. DateCells and EventItems are not set up 
to handle events. It by design is stateless so that you can hook the component 
up to your favorite state management tool (i.e., Redux, Apollo, React Hooks, etc.) to change 
the currently shown month. The example below uses react hooks. 

## Notes 

- Today's date triggers the selected property on the date header
