# Calendar Header 

This component is a basic heading generally used to display 
the month the calendar is currently showing. It also comes with 
two spots to put controls for the calendar itself (i.e., left and right). 
In the example below the left and right containers are filled with the
also provided `<Chevron />` component in this library.

To style this component add a style object to your theme of the form

```js dark
{
  calendar: {
    header: {
      // Styles go here..
    }
  }
}
```

<Preview>
  <Story id="themed-components-calendar-header--basic-usage"/>
</Preview>

## Calendar Header Props 

<Props />
