# Event Item

This component represents an event object. Generally it is overlayed on top of
`<DateCell />` components by absolute positioning. Since both this component and 
date cell handle events its useful to be able to hide all events so that the user can
more easily select the date cells. When this components `hidden` prop is set to true
events don't get triggered and instead get passed to the component underneath it. 

Try it out in the example below. Curently the event item is on top of a `<div />` that registers 
select events. When the event is not hidden then it won't call its handler function. But if you
click the "Hide Top Event" button it will.
