# Getting Started

This library provides many useful components that integrate the [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) library and 
the `@react-calendar/core` library together. The main thing this library provides is components that can be easily 
dropped into the core library but also have [theme-ui variants](https://theme-ui.com/guides/variants) to make it
easy to style your calendar in a way that is consistent to your site or app's overal theme.

## Installing 

### NPM 

```bash 
npm install --save @react-calendar/themed theme-ui react react-dom
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @react-calendar/themed theme-ui react react-dom
```

## Optional (But helpful)

While it's not required to use this library but [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) 
is really useful in conjunction with this one. 

```bash
yarn add date-fns 
```
