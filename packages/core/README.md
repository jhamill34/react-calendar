# React Calendar Core

<!-- Checkout documentation for this library: [React Calendar Core]() -->

Typically this library is only going to be used if you want full customization of your calendar from 
using custom components to conditional rendering. The main purpose of the core library is to 
schedule where events should go in relation to a surrounding interval. `@react-calendar/themed` heavily uses 
this library in conjunction to [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com)
