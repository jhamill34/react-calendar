# Date Row 

A date row can be thought of as a glorified `map` function for intervals, except 
specific to maping dates to react components. At minimum this component needs to know
the interval to generate and what to do with each date object. 

One thing to keep in mind is that **the start value is inclusive** and the **end value is exclusive**. 
In the basic usage example below we actually pass a an interval object that starts on February 1st 2020 
and the end date is specified to be February 5th 2020 (which is **NOT** rendered).
