# Calendar Row 

This component abstracts away the idea of layering two components on top of each other in a basic way. 
It allows us to be able to create a component that lives in the background while being able to have a 
component live on top of it that just fills the space that the background creates.

One thing to note about this component is the responsibility that each component takes. The background 
(i.e. `bg`) gets to dictate the size of the overall container while the foreground (i.e., `fg`) gets to 
come along for the ride and just fill the space.
