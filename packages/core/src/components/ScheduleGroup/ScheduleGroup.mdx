# Schedule Group 

This component determines a situation for events such that no two events are overlapping 
(i.e., scheduled events). After this configuration is computed the rendering is delegated
to the parent component on how it actually should render a group of non-overlapping events. 

In the following examples each group is passed three events where both event 1 and 2 are not overlapping
but both overlap event 3 forcing event 3 to be rendered it its own row.

## Basic Usage

## With Leading Space

One of the optional props that comes with this component is `leadingSpace`. 
If left as `undefined` then no space is added but any positive number is interpreted
as the amount of `em` to leave in front before rendering the groups. 

Notice how it actually renders a space. This is so that you can potentially
render a small window to see informatio underneath these components. This component
is generally rendered on top of a series of dates.

## With Extra Rows

Another optional prop that comes with this component is `numEventRows`. 
If left as `undefined` then each row takes up an equal amount of space according to flexbox rules.
If this value is supplied then the number of rows is static and will be evenly 
distributed according to the value passed to this prop. If the number of total rows 
is greater than the value passed then the number of rows is trunkated to `numEventRows`. 

If there are not enough then empty rows, then rows added until the number of rows is equal to `numEventRows`.

Notice how the render method gets called one extra time 
to render an empty list of events.
