# Schedule Row 

This component takes a list of non-overlapping events and determines the space between each other
and the boundary of the row that they are being placed in. Aside from the actual events and the
render function this component requires an interval that acts as the boundary of this group. 
For each of the elements the component delegates to its parent on how it should be rendered. 

In the following examples the boundary is 5 days in length (February 1st through February 5th). 
There are two events that are contained within the boundary. The first one is from February 1st to the 2nd. 
The second one is just the 4th.

## With Empty Element 

Its nice to be able render each event but what if we want to be able do the opposite? Render the spaces between
each event? Here we can leaverage the optional prop `emptyElement`.
