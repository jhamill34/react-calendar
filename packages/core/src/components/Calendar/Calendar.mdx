# Calendar

A calendar component when rendered computes which groups the passed events
should belong to and then delegates how to render each "group" to the 
parent component. 

In the below example we have five events that are to be grouped into their 
weeks. In this case we want to render the entire month of *December* with group
sizes equal to the typical week length (i.e. 7). After determining this groping we
find that the first three events are grouped into the first week, and events 3 and 4 
are grouped into the second week. No other events are grouped into the remaining weeks. 

Take note that event 3 spans two weeks and gets split between the two.
